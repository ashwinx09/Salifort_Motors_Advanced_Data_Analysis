# Salifort Motors Advanced Data Analysis

<br>

Salifort Motors is facing a significant challenge with high employee turnover, impacting productivity and increasing costs. To address this, the leadership team seeks to leverage advanced data analytics to predict which employees are most at risk of leaving and take proactive steps to improve retention. HR has collected comprehensive survey data from employees, capturing various factors such as job satisfaction, compensation, work-life balance, and engagement. Now, they are looking for a highly skilled data professional to analyze this data and build a predictive model that can accurately forecast employee departures. The data expert will apply advanced statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms—such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting—to identify key patterns and risk factors associated with turnover. By developing a scalable, data-driven model, Salifort Motors aims to shift from a reactive to a proactive HR strategy, allowing leadership to address turnover risks more effectively, improve employee satisfaction, and ultimately reduce the financial and operational impacts of high turnover. This initiative will enable the company to take targeted action based on data-driven insights, ensuring long-term workforce stability and organizational success.
